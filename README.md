## About EOS-BSK:


### Who I am?

```shell

Firstly, about the web name: bsk.
Byron, Shelley, Keats are my favorite poets. So BSK is short for Byron, Shelley,  Keats.

I am initiator of EOS Workflow project.
I am an engineer, more exact I am a blockchain software engineer.
That is enough, Who I am is not important.

What we can do together is the key.


```


### What I do?

```shell

To help make EOS more powerful, I plan to build the workflow engine to help more financial dapps to integrate EOS Network.
If you don't understand what I mean, I will explain briefly:

What is the most serious problem of BTC, ETH or EOS in financial business?
The privacy protection!
This is the reason why they can not go further.



For instance, if MorganStanley and JPMorgan want to build financial business on EOS network, their transaction data will expose to each other. This is unjustified, Competitors share sensitive data.
This is why BTC/ETH/EOS could not be a part of business.
Maybe Corda and Fabric have some solutions, but not applicable for EOS Network.

Why EOS?
I research several projects, EOS Network has greater potentiality.
I believe EOS will bring the revolution.


If you think this project is a joke, you must not be a professional.

Let's turn it into reality together.

```


### Why us?


```shell

In order to isolate sensitive data, workflow engine should trigger localized transactions.
To run workflow engine based on EOS network, need token BKS.
I plan to airdrop all BKS token to 30w EOS accounts.
Every one will get BSK.

Why 30W EOS accounts?
Until now, 308005 accounts in EOS network.


To airdrop token to accounts cost many ram resource.
I am not rich, I donate all my EOS about 310 EOS to deploy the smart contract and buy ram to airdrop more accounts.

If you want to join in, you could donate EOS to this account: eosiobskteam.
Or buy ram for the account: eosiobskteam directly.
All the EOS will used to buy ram, yout donation will help to airdrop more accounts.


As a reward for your donation, your account name will list in the sector: Donors.
And get equal value token(1 EOS = 1000 BSK).

Let us to make the EOS more powerful, build our own community.

```




### You?

```shell

The design documents and code of workflow engine will open source in GitHub.

You could help to optimal design, make workflow engine more stronger.
You could help to contribute code, make workflow engine more specific.
You could help to test the code, make workflow engine more safe.
You could denote EOS or directly buy ram for account: eosiobskteam to help others get BSK.


Stay hungry, stay foolish.
EOS need you, I need you, BSK need you.
